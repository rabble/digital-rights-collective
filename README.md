## About the Project

The Digital Rights Collective has created a **Social Media Bill of Rights** to reclaim our digital spaces from platforms that treat human connection as a commodity. Just as the original Bill of Rights protected individual freedoms from government overreach, we need fundamental protections for our digital communities from corporate control and surveillance capitalism.

### The Five Fundamental Rights

1. **Privacy & Security** - The ability to communicate and organize without fear of surveillance or exploitation. Your conversations, connections, and personal data should be protected from corporate and government intrusion.

2. **Ownership** - People and their communities must own their digital identities, connections and data, including the right to be forgotten. Your online presence should belong to you, not corporations.

3. **Interoperability & The Right To Exit** - The freedom to port your community in its entirety to another app without losing your connections and content. No walled gardens, no captive communities.

4. **Algorithmic Transparency & Control** - Choosing the algorithms that shape your interactions: no more black box systems optimizing for engagement at the expense of community well-being.

5. **Self-governance** - Communities need the right to self-govern, setting their own rules for behavior which are contextually relevant to their community. No more one-size-fits-all moderation.

These fundamental rights are essential for building a healthy, open social media ecosystem that prioritizes user agency, community well-being, and sustainable digital spaces. Embracing these principles is crucial as we work toward a more equitable and human-centered internet.

The Social Media Bill of Rights isn't just a critiqueâ€”it's a roadmap for building better digital spaces that respect human dignity, strengthen communities, and foster genuine connection rather than extracting value.
